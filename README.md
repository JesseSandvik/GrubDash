# GrubDash

This is a back end project for a startup called GrubDash!
This project was built using JavaScript and Express.
This was a great exercise for building RESTful API's with complex validation.

The two main folders of the project are for dishes, and orders.

The dish folder contains the controller and router files for the dishes, with the controller file containing all functions for 'get', 'post', and 'put' requests.
The dish router file contains the routing as well as an implemented 'all' route to work as an error handler.

The orders folder contains the controller and router files for the orders, with the controller file containing all functions for 'get', 'post', 'put', and 'delete' requests.
The order router file contains the routing as well as the same 'all' route to work as an error handler.
